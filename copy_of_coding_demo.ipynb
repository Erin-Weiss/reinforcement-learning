We want to give the robot a location of the desired item(s) and the starting place of the robot, and the robot should be able to figure out the shortest path to go and retrieve the objects. The robot must avoid obstacles in its path, or it will get a negative reward if it runs into it. To incentivize the robot to move to the desired location(s) as quickly as possible, there is also a slight negative reward for every step it takes.\n",

However, it may be beneficial to have a decaying epsilon strategy (meaning that it will start at 100% exploration and move to 100%--or close to it—exploitation). A decaying epsilon strategy has several advantages over a constant epsilon strategy, but the main one is that it can help the Agent converge faster to the optimal policy. However, if the decay rate is high, the Agent might get stuck if it has not explored enough environment space, so in this example, we have kept it to either .001 or .01."

When updating the Q-Table, the higher the learning rate, the more quickly it replaces the new q value (or the more quickly it \"learns\"). A learning rate is a tool that can be used to find how much we keep our previous knowledge of our experience that it needs to keep for our state-action pairs. This is a hyperparameter we can tune, and we will later on in this demo.\n",

If the value is equal to 1, the Agent values future rewards just as much as the current reward, so very high values for gamma might not be best for learning. Conversely, a gamma of zero will cause the Agent to value only immediate rewards, which only works well in certain cases. We will explore what gamma value works best for this model later in this demo.\n"
